# Rubik's Cube
The program was created in C++ using OpenGL. To create this implementation of the Rubik's Cube, I used GLFW, GLAD and GLM libraries. My main source knowledge about OpenGL comes from this link: https://learnopengl.com/.

# How to use
The control is based on notation from this link: https://rubiks.fandom.com/wiki/Notation:
- F key or numpad 1 - F (Front)
- B key or numpad 4 - B (Back)
- U key or numpad 3 - U (Up)
- D key or numpad 6 - D (Down)
- L key or numpad 5 - L (Left)
- R key or numpad 2 - R (Right)
- M key, X key or numpad 7 - M (Middle)
- E key, Y key or numpad 8 - E (Equator)

You can also rotate in the opposite direction by holding down the shift key.
